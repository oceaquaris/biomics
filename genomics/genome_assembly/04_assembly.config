#1) avg_ins
#   This value indicates the average insert size of this library or the peak
#   value position in the insert size distribution figure.
#2) reverse_seq
#   This option takes value 0 or 1. It tells the assembler if the read
#   sequences need to be complementarily reversed.
#   Illumima GA produces two types of paired-end libraries: a) forward-reverse,
#   generated from fragmented DNA ends with typical insert size less than 500
#   bp; b) reverse-forward, generated from circularizing libraries with typical
#   insert size greater than 2 Kb. The parameter "reverse_seq" should be set to
#   indicate this: 0, forward-reverse; 1, reverse-forward.
#3) asm_flags
#   This indicator decides in which part(s) the reads are used. It takes value
#   1(only contig assembly), 2 (only scaffold assembly), 3(both contig and
#   scaffold assembly), or 4 (only gap closure).
#4) rd_len_cutof
#   The assembler will cut the reads from the current library to this length.
#5) rank
#   It takes integer values and decides in which order the reads are used for
#   scaffold assembly. Libraries with the same "rank" are used at the same time
#   during scaffold assembly.
#6) pair_num_cutoff
#   This parameter is the cutoff value of pair number for a reliable connection
#   between two contigs or pre-scaffolds. The minimum number for paired-end
#   reads and mate-pair reads is 3 and 5 respectively.
#7) map_len
#   This takes effect in the "map" step and is the minimun alignment length
#   between a read and a contig required for a reliable read location. The
#   minimum length for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 32 and 35
#   respectively.
